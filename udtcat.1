.SH UDT
UDP-based Data Transfer(UDT) is a reliable 
.BR UDP (7)
based application level data transport protocol for distributed data intensive applications over wide area high-speed networks. UDT uses UDP to transfer bulk data with its own reliability control and congestion control mechanisms. The new protocol can transfer data at a much higher speed than TCP does. read more at
